Welcome to my blog. This will serve as a place for me to learn in public and as a collection of my thoughts. 
  
## What's next  
I plan to make continous improvements on the look and feel of my website, so long as it remains novel and engaging.

Time will tell what shape this takes. I'm hoping to create a coherent narrative around what I find interesting in life. You can expect reflections on current events, deep dives into niche subjects, and explorations of the abstract ideas that occupy my mind.

Please see this as a seeker's memoir. Part philosophy, part obscure ramblings. Nothing groundbreaking, but hopefully something worth your time.
